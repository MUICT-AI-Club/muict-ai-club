Our club recently hosted an exciting talk titled "Deep into the Fundamental: How Maths Makes ML Magical" by Pat Vatiwutipong (P'Gui), the creator of the page คณิตศาสตร์อย่างที่ควรจะเป็น. The session took place on March 23, 2025, at the Faculty of ICT, Mahidol University. We kicked off the event with a brief introduction to machine learning, followed by an engaging experience-sharing session.
